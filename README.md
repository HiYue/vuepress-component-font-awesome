# Font Awesome component for Vuepress

This plugin allows you to use Font Awesome icons in Vuepress markdown file directly. 
> **Support regular and solid icons ONLY**

---
## How to Use

Each icon's used as a Vuepress component, so you just need to input a directive start with `Fa-` then follow the Capitalised font awesome icon class name, for example:

```markdown
<!-- Insert a address book icon, red colour, 3x large size -->
<Fa-AddressBook color="red" size="3x" />
```
---
## Install
- Step 1: Install dependency
```bash
yarn add vuepress-plugin-font-awesome
```
- Step 2: Create a shortcut script, please add following codes  in your `package.json` file
```json
  "scripts": {
    "fa:build": "node node_modules/vuepress-plugin-font-awesome/index.js"
  }
```
---
## Generate Font Awesome components

### Generate all font awesome icon components
> Simply run following command:
```bash
yarn fa:build
```

> If in your project, you root folder is in other place, for example: 'docs', then pass the `dest` option:
```bash
yarn fa:build --dest=docs
```

The plugin will put the font awesome components in right place, which is `.vuepress/components/Fa`.

### Generate specified icons only

By default, there are 152 regular and 957 solid icon components will be generated, which is a huge amount. Instead of pack them all, you might want to only generate some specified icons based on your demand. To do so, simply put them in the .vuepress/config.js file as below:
```javascript
module.exports = {
    title: 'Hello VuePress',
    description: 'Just playing around',

    // Please append following lines into your config.js
    thirdPartyComponents: {
        fontAwesomeIcons:{
            regular:['address-card','file-audio'],  // Regular font awesome icon keys here
            solid:['battery-quarter']               // Solid font awesome icon keys here
        }
    }
  }
```
> If you don't know what icon's key you could use, please refer the following:
- [Font Awesome Regular icons](./lib/regular-icons.txt)
- [Font Awesome Solid icons](./lib/solid-icons.txt)

The command is exactly same as above:
```bash
yarn fa:build
```
**OR**
```bash
yarn fa:build --dest=$YOUR_DOCS
```
